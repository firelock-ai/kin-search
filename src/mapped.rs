//! # The text index served from a mapping
//!
//! The heap index holds a `String` per distinct token, a `HashMap<Id, Vec<f32>>`
//! per token, a forward map naming every occurrence, a vocabulary, and a trigram
//! index rebuilt on the first fuzzy query after every commit. On a VS Code tree
//! that is gigabytes of resident memory whose only job is to answer questions
//! that a file could answer.
//!
//! This module is the format that answers them from a file instead. A segment is
//! one immutable file holding an FST term dictionary, block-compressed postings
//! and a document table. The reader maps it, and what it retains is the mapping
//! handle, a few counters and one bit per document. The term dictionary, the
//! postings and the document table are pages, never allocations.
//!
//! ## What the format has to preserve, and why it is not negotiable
//!
//! The scorer this crate ships is not BM25 over term frequencies. It saturates
//! the FIELD WEIGHT once per token OCCURRENCE and sums those, which is why a
//! posting carries a document's weights as a sequence rather than a count:
//!
//! ```text
//! for weight in weights {
//!     score += idf * (weight * (K1 + 1)) / (weight + K1 * (1 - B + B * dl / avgdl)) * penalty
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Float addition is not associative, so `n` additions of `saturate(w)` is not
//! `n * saturate(w)`, and the run-length encoding below expands a run back into
//! that many additions rather than collapsing it into a multiply. Everything
//! else that fixes the result is preserved verbatim: BM25 k1 1.2 and b 0.75, an
//! IDF whose `df` counts distinct live documents, a substring penalty of 0.5,
//! substring matches visited in sorted token order, and the final tie-break on
//! `format!("{id:?}")`. A guard asserts the mapped reader's results are
//! bit-identical to the heap index's on the same corpus, for exact and fuzzy
//! queries alike.
//!
//! ## Deletes without a forward map
//!
//! The heap index keeps a forward map for one reason: to remove a document you
//! have to know which tokens it contributed. That map is where most of the
//! memory went. Here a delete sets one bit in a tombstone bitset carried in the
//! manifest, which is rewritten on every commit anyway, and every posting walk
//! skips tombstoned ordinals. A term's `df` is the stored count when its segment
//! has no tombstones and a counted walk when it does, so IDF stays exact rather
//! than drifting as documents are removed.
//!
//! ## Substring matching without a trigram index
//!
//! The two substring directions are not the same query and they do not want the
//! same machinery.
//!
//! - `token.contains(qt)`, the ordinary direction, is one traversal of the
//!   mapped FST under a `.*qt.*` automaton. It allocates nothing.
//! - `qt.contains(token)`, the reverse direction, is a bounded enumeration of
//!   the only substrings of `qt` that can match, each one exact lookup. The
//!   floor is `ceil(3 * qt.len() / 4)` bytes and at least [`MIN_SUBSTRING_LEN`],
//!   so the count is quadratic in the quarter above the floor rather than in the
//!   query: 21 candidates for a 20-byte token, 66 for 40 bytes, 1,326 for 200.
//!   Long query tokens are ordinary input, because `tokenize` emits whole path
//!   and identifier segments, so the loop is bounded by the floor rather than
//!   scanning every start and end pair.
//!
//! Against that, the trigram index costs a full vocabulary walk allocating a
//! `Box<str>` per token, on the first fuzzy query after every commit, load or
//! rebuild, and then holds a second copy of the vocabulary for the life of the
//! epoch.
